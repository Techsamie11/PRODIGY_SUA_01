# PRODIGY_SUA_01
<b><h2>Overview</b></h2>
This repository contains the code and documentation for an individual full-stack development project, focused on building a Secure User Authentication System. The project is designed to verify a user’s identity before granting access to a system, ensuring data security and controlled access.The system implements core authentication functionalities such as user registration, login, and validation, with secure interaction between the frontend and backend. 
<br>The <b>backend</b> logic is developed using JSP and JDBC, while PostgreSQL is used for reliable and efficient database management. 
<br>The <b>frontend</b> is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface.
<br>This project helped in understanding secure authentication workflows, database connectivity, and full-stack application development, making it a valuable learning experience in real-world web application security.
